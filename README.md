Big_Ideas_Part1
This program is designed to facilitate the recording of student attendance.
Students can sign into class by entering their names and student IDs, which are then timestamped and saved to an attended.txt file for later reference.
The program runs in a loop, allowing continuous sign-in until manually terminated.

#Features
  Timestamped sign-in with date and time.
  Continuous input until the program is explicitly stopped.
  Attendance records saved in attended.txt for easy tracking and grading.
#Usage
  Run the program.
  Enter student name and student ID when prompted.
  To stop the program and finalize the sign-in sheet, enter 0 when prompted.
